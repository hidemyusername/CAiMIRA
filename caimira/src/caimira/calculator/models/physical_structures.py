enclosed spaces. These characteristics are essential for various calculations
within the simulation, including ventilation and concentration modeling.

    Represents an enclosed physical space, such as a room or an office.

        volume: The total volume of the room in cubic meters (m^3).

        inside_temp: A PiecewiseConstant object representing the temperature

        humidity: The relative humidity in the room, expressed as a fraction

            array. Defaults to 0.5.
